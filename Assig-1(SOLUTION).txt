Q3>>  What is default package in JAVA?
SOL:  The default package is a collection of java classes whose source files do not 
      contain and package declarations. These packages act as the default package for
      such classes. It provides the ease of creating small applications when the 
      development of any project or application has just begun.

}


Q8>>  Write a program to display the names of your friends by calling the static methods.
SOL:  public class StaticFreiendName {
	static String FName = "Jessica";
	static void display()
	{
		System.out.println(" My Friends name is: " + FName);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		display();

	}

}


Q9>>  Explain the public static void main(String[] args) in detail.
SOL:  Java main method is the entry point of any java program. Its syntax is always
      public static void main(String[] args). You can only change the name of String 
      array argument, for example you can change args to myStringArgs. 
      Also String array argument can be written as String... args or String args[].
      
      public: This is the access modifier of the main method. It has to be public so
              that java runtime can execute this method

      static: When java runtime starts, there is no object of the class present. 
              That’s why the main method has to be static so that JVM can load the 
              class into memory and call the main method. If the main method won’t 
              be static, JVM would not be able to call it because there is no object
              of the class is present.
    
      void:   Java programming mandates that every method provide the return type. 
              Java main method doesn’t return anything, that’s why it’s return type 
              is void. This has been done to keep things simple because once the main
              method is finished executing, java program terminates.

     main:    This is the name of java main method. It’s fixed and when we start a 
              java program, it looks for the main method.

     String[]args:  ava main method accepts a single argument of type String array. 
                    This is also called as java command line arguments

Q10>>  What are the rules of naming the java file.?
SOL:  Packages: Names should be in lowercase. ...
      Classes: Names should be in CamelCase. ...
      Interfaces: Names should be in CamelCase. ...
      Methods: Names should be in mixed case. ...
      Variables: Names should be in mixed case. ...
      Constants: Names should be in uppercase.

Q11>>  what are the rules of naming the class?
SOL:   Class names should be nouns, in mixed cases with the first letter of each 
       internal word capitalized. Interfaces names should also be capitalized just 
       like class names.

Q12>>  what are the rules for naming the methods?
SOL:   Methods should be verbs in lowerCamelCase or a multi-word name that begins with 
       a verb in lowercase; that is, with the first letter lowercase and the first 
       letters of subsequent words in uppercase. Local variables, instance variables,
       and class variables are also written in lowerCamelCase.

Q13>>  what are the rules for naming variables in java?
SOL:   Variable names are case-sensitive.
       Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore 
       characters.
       If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all 
       lowercase letters.

Q14>>  which is the main entry point of java program
SOL:   public static void main(String[] args){
       }

Q15>>  who is invoking the main method of java ?
SOL:   Jvm starts main thread to call main method

Q16>>  why main has to be static method components of java program are?
SOL:   When java runtime starts, there is no object of the class present. 
       That's why the main method has to be static so that JVM can load the class 
       into memory and call the main method. If the main method won't be static, 
       JVM would not be able to call it because there is no object of the class is present.


Q17>>  what is jvm,jre,jdk?
SOL:   JDK = Java Runtime Environment (JRE) + Development tools. 
       JRE = Java Virtual Machine (JVM) + Libraries to run the application. 
       JVM = Only Runtime environment for executing the Java byte code.

Q18>>  Explain the components of compile time environments and run time environments.?
SOL:   Runtime environment is a state of the target machine, which may include software
       libraries, environment variables, etc., to provide services to the processes 
       running in the system.

Q19>>  what is JIT?
SOL:   Just-in-time, or JIT, is an inventory management method in which goods are received 
       from suppliers only as they are needed. The main objective of this method is to 
       reduce inventory holding costs and increase inventory turnover.

Q20>>  different types of memory in jvm?
SOL:   Loading of code
       Verification of code
       Executing the code
       It provides a run-time environment to the users

Q21>>  In which area .class is stored?
SOL:   All the class variable primitive or object references (which is just a pointer 
       to location where object is stored i.e. heap) are also stored in heap. Classes 
       loaded by ClassLoader and static variables and static object references are stored 
       in a special location in heap which permanent generation.

Q22>>  In which area object are stored?
SOL:   All objects in Java are stored on the heap. The "variables" that hold references
       to them can be on the stack or they can be contained in other objects (then they
       are not really variables, but fields), which puts them on the heap also. The Class
       objects that define Classes are also heap objects.

Q23>>  Why do we call as java simple?
SOL:   Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to 
       understand. According to Sun Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming 
       language because: Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).

Q24>>  Write a program to display names of days by using commandLine arguments.?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STATIC VARIABLE:-1> class variable, it is a part of class not object
                 3> memory is allocated  during complition time not during run time
                 4> life span of class variable is more than that of instance variable
                 5> static variavle memory deallocation when we close the application
                 6> instance variable memory deallocates when object is garbage collected
                 7> static variable is comman for all the objects
                 8> instance variables is not common, every object has their own instance variables
                 9> static variable retains its value throught the program..
by providing the setter methor the properties are writable
by proviging the getter method the properties are readable
